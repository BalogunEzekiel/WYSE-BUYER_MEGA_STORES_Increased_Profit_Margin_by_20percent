# Wyse-Buyer Mega Stores: Increased Profit Margin by 20%

I’m excited to share my latest project. I generated a dynamic, interactive sales dashboard visualization for Wyse-Buyer Mega Stores! Leveraging powerful tools such as SQL, Excel and Power Query, I transformed raw data into actionable insights that drove real business impact.

This sales dashboard not only visually represented key metrics but also empowered Wyse-Buyer Mega Stores to make data-driven decisions. Here’s what we achieved together:

1. Boosted Profit Margins – The dashboard helped improve the profit margin by an impressive 20% in the first half of year 2024, setting the business on a path for continued growth.

2. Strategic Decision-Making – With clear and concise insights, management was able to make informed decisions on business strategies, from pricing adjustments to inventory management.

3. Optimized Operations – By streamlining critical data points, we enabled more efficient service delivery, saving both time and resources across various segments.
